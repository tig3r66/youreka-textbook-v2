# Getting publication-ready

As the chapter name suggests, this chapter is all about getting publication-quality plots.

## Line plot

A line plot is another way to visualize continuous variables. This is particularly useful when 

  1. Your observations change over time and
  2. You want to demonstrate a causal relationship. 

Let's elaborate on the second point. In the previous case for life expectancy and GDP, we could only observe a correlation, but cannot conclude a causal relationship. In some case, such as carrying out a laboratory experiment or a simulation study, you can precisely manipulate certain independent variables and measure other dependent variables. This way you can argue for a better causal relationship. For example, you can change the concentration of a drug treatment and measure the inhibition effect.

Let's take a look at the life expectancy of Africa over the years. Let's first create a scatter plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data = subset(gapminder, continent == "Europe"), aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point()
```

Since the points can correspond to the countries, we can connect them with lines.

```{r}
ggplot(data = subset(gapminder, continent == "Europe"), 
       aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, colour = country)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = country))
```

Here the `group = country` specifies that points with the same values for the variable `country` should be connected in a line.

Oftentimes you want to show line plots with mean values and error bars. Unfortunately, ggplot2 can't automatically draw error bars -- you have to explicitly specify the values. We're going to address this in the next example.

First, calculate the mean and SEM and save it to a new data frame.

```{r}
df <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(year, continent) %>%
  summarise(mean_le = mean(lifeExp), sd=sd(lifeExp), sem = sd(lifeExp)/sqrt(n()))
```

Next, draw a line plot with this data frame. To draw error bars, we need to specify the upper and lower limits within `geom_errorbar()`.

```{r}
lineplot <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = year, y = mean_le, color = continent)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_le-sem, ymax = mean_le+sem),
                position = position_dodge(0.05))  # position_dodge() sets length of error bar caps
show(lineplot)
```

Finally, let's format the figure nicely.

```{r}
lineplot <- lineplot + labs(x = "Year", y = "Life Expectancy", color = "Continent") +
  theme_classic() +                      # remove the gray background
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16))  # set font size
show(lineplot)
```

For a cleaner view with offset axis:

```{r}
lineplot <- lineplot +
  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),  # hide the default axes
        axis.ticks.length = unit(7, 'pt')) +
  # specify the breaks of y-axis
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(40,80,20), limits=c(35,85), expand=c(0,0)) +
  # specify the breaks of x-axis
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1950, 2010, 20), limits=c(1945,2010), expand=c(0,0)) +
  # specify the location of the new y-axis
  geom_segment(y=40, yend=80, x=1945, xend=1945, lwd=0.5, colour="black", lineend="square") +
  # specify the location of the new x-axis
  geom_segment(y=35, yend=35, x=1950, xend=2010, lwd=0.5, colour="black", lineend="square")
show(lineplot)

ggsave("data/10_pubvis/life_year.png", plot = lineplot)
```


## Bar plot

### Basics

Let's look at the life expectancy of all continents in 1977 using a bar plot. Notice that instead of using `dplyr`, we can simply use the base R `subset()` function. Recall `df` from the previous section.

```{r}
ggplot(data = subset(df, year == 1977), aes(x=continent, y=mean_le)) +
  geom_col()
```

Note by default, `geom_col` takes both x and y while `geom_bar` takes only x and plots the count on y. Just as before, we can add error bars:

```{r}
ggplot(data = subset(df, year == 1977), aes(x=continent, y=mean_le)) +
  geom_col() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_le - sem, ymax = mean_le + sem), width=0.5,
                 position=position_dodge(0.05))
```

We can compare 1977 and 2007 by setting`fill = as.factor(year)`.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = subset(df, year %in% c(1977, 2007)), 
       aes(x=continent, y=mean_le, fill = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge(), color = "black") + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_le - sem, ymax = mean_le + sem), width=0.5,
                 position=position_dodge(0.9))
show(p)
```

Finally, let's make this figure publication-ready:

```{r}
p <- p +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('black', 'white')) +
  labs(x = 'Continent', y='Mean life expectancy (years)', fill = 'Year') +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(text = element_text(size=16)) +
  # removes space between bottom of bars and x-axis
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0))
p
```


### Plotting significance (OPTIONAL)

Next we can run some statistical tests and add significance stars (*) to the plot. We'll compare if the life expectancy in Africa in 1977 and 2007 has changed.

```{r}
africa.1977.lifeExp <- gapminder %>% filter(continent == 'Africa', year == 1977) %>% select(lifeExp)
africa.2007.lifeExp <- gapminder %>% filter(continent == 'Africa', year == 2007) %>% select(lifeExp)
t.test(africa.1977.lifeExp, africa.2007.lifeExp)
```

The p-value is 0.001917. Here are common ranges for different p-values: 0 **** 0.0001 *** 0.001 ** 0.01 * 0.05 ns 1. We should use ** in this case. To draw the significance stars, we need the `ggsignif` package.

```{r}
# install.packages("ggsignif")
library(ggsignif)
meanLE.77.07 <- p + geom_signif(y_position = 60, xmin = 0.75, xmax = 1.25, # position of the stars
              annotations = "**", tip_length = 0.05)
meanLE.77.07
```

There are more ways to draw the significant stars in R. For example, `ggpubr` even allows you to run the tests and plot the stars in the same line. 

However, I do not encourage you to do so. Manually adding the stars might be a bit tedious (in terms of adjusting the positions and tip length), but you are not as restricted by the package in terms of the tests you can do.


## Box plot

Box plots are extremely versatile. Here are 2 reasons:

  1. You don't need to calculate the mean and error for box plots (remember we used `df` for bar plots).
  2. Many high-profile journals ask authors to submit graphs that shows not only the statistical description (mean and error), but also the dots for the raw data. Box plots are well suited for this purpose.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = subset(gapminder, year %in% c(1977, 2007)), 
            aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp, color = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_boxplot(position = position_dodge(0.8))
show(p)
```

Let's add the data points. Here I use `geom_jitter` to avoid overlapping. Please note that `position_jitterdodge` introduces random noise to the x position of the points to make it easier to read. But since we are plotting against a categorical variable, the exact x position doesn't matter.

```{r}
p <- p + geom_point(position = position_jitterdodge(0.4), alpha = 0.65)
```

Use `stat_summary` show data points and statistics together.

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
p <- ggplot(data = subset(gapminder, year %in% c(1977, 2007)), 
            aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp, color = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitterdodge(0.4), alpha = 0.65) +
  theme_classic() +
  # adds error bar
  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_sdl, fun.args = list(mult=1),
        geom="errorbar", width=0.3, position = position_dodge(0.7), size = 1) +
  # adds mean pooint to the error bar
  stat_summary(fun=mean, geom="point", position = position_dodge(0.7), size = 3)
show(p)
```

Add asterisks and format the plot.

```{r}
p <- p +
  geom_signif(y_position = 85, xmin = 0.75, xmax = 1.25, annotations = "**", tip_length = 0.02, color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Continents", y = "Life Expectancy (years)", color = "Year") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16))  # make text larger
show(p)
```

We can again offset the axes.

```{r}
offset_box <- p +
  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),  # hide the default axes
        axis.ticks.length = unit(7, 'pt')) +
  # Specify the breaks of y-axis
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(30,90,30), limits=c(25,95), expand=c(0,0)) +
  # Specify location of x-axis
  geom_segment(y=30, yend=90, x=0.4, xend=0.4, lwd=0.5, colour="black", lineend="square") +
  # Specify location of y-axis
  geom_segment(y=25, yend=25, x=1, xend=5, lwd=0.5, colour="black", lineend="square")
show(offset_box)
```

Now we can save this publication-ready figure.

```{r}
ggsave('data/10_pubvis/life_year_jitter.png', plot = offset_box)
```


## Histogram and density plot

Since these have been covered extensively in previous labs, I'm going to go through this section rather quickly. The histogram and density plot are great tools for looking at distributions of a single variable:

```{r}
ggplot(data = subset(gapminder, year == 2007), aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = '#69B3A2')
ggplot(data = subset(gapminder, year == 2007), aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_density(fill = '#69B3A2')
```

We can also use these plots to compare distributions.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  # 2007 data and label
  geom_density(data = subset(gapminder, year == 2007),
               aes(x = lifeExp, y = ..density..), fill = '#69B3A2') +
  geom_label(aes(x=40, y=0.03, label='2007'), colour = '#69B3A2') +
  # 1977 data and label
  geom_density(data = subset(gapminder, year == 1977),
               aes(x = lifeExp, y = -..density..), fill = '#404080') +
  geom_label(aes(x=40, y=-0.03, label='1977'), colour = '#404080') +
  theme_minimal()
```

Perhaps a histogram would be better for our purposes.

```{r}
hist.07.77 <- ggplot() +
  # 2007 data and label
  geom_histogram(data = subset(gapminder, year == 2007),
                 aes(x = lifeExp, y = ..density..), fill = '#69B3A2') +
  geom_label(aes(x=40, y=0.03, label='2007'), colour = '#69B3A2') +
  # 1977 data and label
  geom_histogram(data = subset(gapminder, year == 1977),
                 aes(x = lifeExp, y = -..density..), fill = '#404080') +
  geom_label(aes(x=40, y=-0.03, label='1977'), colour = '#404080') +
  theme_minimal()
hist.07.77
```


## Assembly of multiple figures (OPTIONAL)

Many figures in academic journals include multiple subfigures within a figure. 

To assemble many graphs into one figure, usually we use a graphical design software such as Illustrator, Inkscape or even PowerPoint. 

If you are able to generate all subfigures within one single R script (so that all the `ggplot2` objects are present together), you could go on to use R package `patchwork` to assemble them into a big figure.

(Please note that this could be a very rare scenario when conducting serious research - Each subfigures may require intense computation and modelling work that are performed with several scripts. They may even come from different people - your teammates and collaborators. You don't always have access to all te subfigures within one workspace. Most of the time you would still find yourself using graphical design softwares to assemble the figures.)

```{r}
# install.packages('patchwork')
library(patchwork)
```

Here is a super simple example: just add the plots together! Recall that these variables were saved throughout our lab.

```{r}
hist.07.77 + lineplot
```

We can also do something a bit more complicated:

```{r}
(hist.07.77 + lineplot) / offset_box
```

We can also add spacing between plots:

```{r}
patch <- (hist.07.77 + plot_spacer() + lineplot) /
  (meanLE.77.07 + theme(text=element_text(size=12)))
patch
```

Most figures in papers are annotated. In most cases, plots are combined using a photoshop tool. Labels are usually also added with a photoshop tool. For whatever reason you wish to programmatically add labels, here's howyou do it:

```{r}
(hist.07.77 + lineplot) / (meanLE.77.07 + theme(text=element_text(size=12))) +
  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')
```

Note that `tag_levels` takes:
  
  1. '1' for Arabic numerals,
  2. 'A' for uppercase Latin letters,
  3. 'a' for lowercase Latin letters,
  4. 'I' for uppercase Roman numerals, and
  5. 'i' for lowercase Roman numerals.

More often than not, we want all of our figures to have the same dimensions. `patchwork` makes it easy for us to do so:

```{r, eval=F}
aligned_plots <- align_patches(lineplot, scatter_trend, meanLE.77.07, offset_box)
for (p in aligned_plots) {
  plot(p)
}
```

That's all there is to it! If you want more customization options, read the official documentation: https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/articles/patchwork.html.


## Extras (OPTIONAL)

### Choropleth

> “The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.” --John Tukey

[The choropleth](https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/choropleth.html) is used to display differences in geographical regions using different colours/shades/patterns. To use map data, we need to install `maps` package.

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("maps")
```

First, let's load `maps` and retrieve all of the data from the year 2007.

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
library(maps)
dat2007 <- gapminder %>% filter(year == 2007)
dat2007 <- dat2007 %>% rename('region' = 'country')
```

Now let's get the world map data. This is necessary because it contains the longitude and latitudes we need to draw the map

```{r}
world_map <- map_data("world")
head(world_map)
```

Whereas `gapminder` names USA and UK 'United States' and 'United Kingdom' respectively, `world_map` names them by their abbreviations. Let's rename the `gapminder` data.

```{r}
dat2007 <- dat2007 %>% mutate(region = fct_recode(region,
                             'USA' = 'United States',
                             'UK' = 'United Kingdom'))
```

We're almost there! Now, we need to merge the data.

```{r}
life.exp.map <- left_join(world_map, dat2007, by = "region")
head(life.exp.map)
```

Finally, we can plot the data. We specify `group` to draw each country individually.

```{r}
# grey means no gapminder data
ggplot(life.exp.map, aes(x=long, y=lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = lifeExp), color = "white") +
  scale_fill_viridis_b(option='D') +
  theme_bw()
```

### Animations

While we covered the most relevant data visualizations for your project, we've barely scratched the surface of what R can do. For example, you can create animations. Let's install the `gganimate` package.

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('thomasp85/gganimate')
```

Next, load the package:

```{r}
library(gganimate)
```

Finally, we can create the plot! This might take a while, but I promise it will be worth the wait!

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, col = country)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = F) +
    scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
    scale_x_log10() +
    scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
    facet_wrap(~continent) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +
    # here is the animation code
    labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', x = 'GDP per capita', y = 'Life expectancy (years)') +
    transition_time(year) +
    ease_aes('linear')
```
