# Install R and RStudio {#install}

Why do we need to install both R and RStudio? Well, the answer is the following: R is the programming language whereas RStudio is the integrated development environment (IDE) for R. You can think of R as the thing that turns your code into commands that your computer runs and RStudio as a fancy text editor (although it is so much more than that!).


## Installing R

1. Go to the [R Project website](https://www.r-project.org/).
2. On the left side bar, click on "CRAN" under "Download". Choose the mirror you wish to download from (e.g., https://mirror.rcg.sfu.ca/mirror/CRAN/)
3. Download the correct version for your OS. Ensure to download the latest release of R.


## Installing RStudio

1. Go to the [RStudio website](https://rstudio.com/).
2. Navigate to the [RStudio page](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) and download RStudio Desktop.

If you have a pre-existing installation of R and/or RStudio, we **highly recommend** that you update both. If you upgrade R, you'll need to update any packages you have installed. Type the following command into the Console in RStudio:

```{r eval=F}
update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)
```

Once you've installed an updated version of R and RStudio, open RStudio. You should get a window similar to this [screenshot](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/rstudio-workbench.png), but yours will be more boring because you havenâ€™t written any code or made any figures yet!

Place your cursor in the pane called "Console", which is where you interact with R. Type `print('Hello World!')` in the console and hit the enter or return key. You should see "Hello World!" print to the screen. If you do, you've succeeded in installing R and RStudio.


## Add-on packages

R contains a huge number of packages that enhances its functionality. People often share useful code they have developed as a package via CRAN and GitHub. To install a package from CRAN (e.g., the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)), type this into the R console:

```{r eval=F}
install.packages('tidyverse', dependencies = TRUE)
```

By including `dependencies = TRUE`, we are including any additional packages our target package requires. Please also install [gapminder](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/gapminder/), [ggsignif](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggsignif/), and [ggpubr](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggpubr/). Without further ado, let's jump into our adventure with R!
